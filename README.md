# Cxx_and_CMake_-_Hello_World
C++ &amp; CMake - Hello World
=============================



This project is a collection of the basics of C++. 

The idea is, I'm well aware, my Java and Python skills are becoming rustier by the day.

Best to scratch this stuff down, before it too begins to fade away. Lol

01 - Hello World
----------------

---

This initial project is extremely simple. We will be creating our C++ file, using vim in a Linux terminal.
If you're so Windows inclined, WSL works just great. Or even Git Bash. We create HelloWorld.cpp, and proceed
to write good C++ code. This is key. Worry a lot, when writing, and write good code once, and don't worry so 
much about it once it's written. Trust the code. 

Next we will be creating our CMakeLists.txt file. This is where CMake goes to find what we want to do. 
A thorough study of CMake is well worth the effort. We start by telling CMake the project name. Then 
the minimum version number, and finally we tell CMake to add an executible file, and how to name it. 

Remove red cover. Remove key from neck and insert, turning clockwise. Press the red button.



Let's build this bad boy.

cd build
cmake ..
